    "<font size=\"6\">1. Data Modelling</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Congratulations! You’ve been hired as part of the new Data Engineering and Management team in the AirBNB Business Intelligence department. The company is restructuring due to unsatisfactory performance from the previous teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving, the head of the Data Modelling department highlighted several issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Storage**: A lot of data about AirBNB listings is stored in a single document. While this approach has some advantages, it has also caused performance issues. Queries are slow, and the team didn’t apply patterns, which could improve performance by optimizing the data model. Indexes were also not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reviews Growth**: The number of reviews for AirBNB is growing rapidly. Currently, we overwrite reviews regularly, but the Business Intelligence department will benefit from storing all reviews and analyzing them over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Errors**: There are errors in the data collection, such as duplicate data entries and incorrect timestamps for transactions. The new team will need to decide how to fix these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Role**: In your new role, you’ll need to consider how each database query is used, how often it is needed, and its impact on reads and writes. You should update the database schema to optimize for business use cases. Use tools like embedding, linking, indexes, and patterns to improve the data model. You may need to create new fields, documents, or collections. Be sure to document the pattern you’re applying and the reasons behind your decisions, especially when dealing with duplication and risks of outdated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key tasks include**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamlining the data collection process.\n",
    "2. Cleaning up the data and optimizing what will be returned for each use case.\n",
    "3. Applying the correct patterns to speed up common queries.\n",
    "4. Ensuring departments get accurate and relevant information from the database.\n",
    "5. Sharing the updated data model schema with other departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practices**: [Check Chapter 6, Mastering MongoDB]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All newly created fields should have capitalized names.\n",
    "2. New queries should work with the most up-to-date database version. If you make multiple changes, all queries should still work after the final updates.\n",
    "3. For some queries, you may need to change the database schema.\n",
    "4. When you are applying specific patterns, like polymorphic, subset, or bucket, name them accordingly. \n",
    "5. Document each major transformation using this format:\n",
    "*“We applied {transformation name} because {reasoning behind it}. We expect {change/result} based on {observable measure, such as query speed, number of documents returned, index use, etc.}.”*\n",

    "**Data Cleanup and Schema Adjustments:** [9 points in total]\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Before working on the queries below, review the data and adjust the schema based on the typical use case described.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Use Case**: The most common use of the database is to show property listing information to customers. A query retrieves a listing document from the database. Currently, retrieving a listing takes too long. Decide what information should be included in a typical query and optimize the structure accordingly. For example, customers usually only need a sample of reviews, not all reviews (even though all reviews are stored). They also don’t need past transaction data. Update the document schema to fit this use case. This might involve creating new collections or documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleanup**: Review the data for any errors (such as transactions that don’t belong to the listing) or unnecessary duplication, and clean it up where needed."

    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Different AirBNB departments require different analytics from our common database.\n",
    "Below are the specific questions from various departments: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Difficulty Questions:** [2 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tOnce a month, we reward hosts with recognition. Select three superhosts with at least two listings that can accommodate more than four people.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tThe company considers inevsting into property to rent. Which bed type is most common in listings with a waterfront and a dishwasher in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tWe're considering hiring someone to write reviews professionally. Who wrote the longest review in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tTo assess the security of different areas, what is the biggest and smallest (price-security deposit) difference per number of visitors at a property?\n",
    "\n",
    "6)  Identify areas by whether they are typically used for short breaks, like weekend mini breaks, or whether they are more suitable for long trips. This information support targeted advertising of different customer types. It is not expected to change much over time so we won’t look to update it, we just require current view. What is the average duration of stay (in nights) per type of property per city (you can use the maximum_nights to measure length of stays)? For each property type return the city with the highest and lowest average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Difficulty Questions (Consider database optimization for these queries):** [3 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "7)\tWe are creating a new webpage for hosts when setting up their account. It will list suggested typical amenities. This data will need to be available every time a host registers a property but is not expected to change very much. The starting point for the list will be all unique amenities currently listed in properties (across all documents). Optimise the database for this use case and show how the data should be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "8)\tWe plan to rtack our reviewers better. We want to create a webpage that shows the top 20 reviewers and the count of the number of reviews of each of these reviewers. This webpage should be kept up to date. It should also have a link to return the number of reviews for a given reviewer ID or Name (show how to query for number of reviews by ID or query quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "9)\tFor each property we store review scores across different metrics (accuracy, check-in, cleanliness etc). We consider adding more metrics, although there is no clarity on what these will be. We want to be able to easily query the average score across all of these metrics, including any new metrics that might be added without changing the query. Adjust the data model so this can be done and show the query for an example property.\n",
    "\n",
    "10)\tWe aim to have better access to information about transaction, we wish to develop a search engine that can calculate the average value of transactions in a given period of time quickly for a given property.\n",
    "\n",
    "11)\tWe wish to have a summary webpage that displays information about our top destinations. This webpage should display for each of the top 10 cities some basic information about our operations in the area (number of properties by type for example, average price by type) but you can choose the metrics. For each of the top 10 cities it should also provide some basic information about the top 3 properties in each city (price, number of review, whatever you think useful) to show an example of the properties available in the area. We would like to keep this webpage up to date as information changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database updates:** [2 points per question]\n",
    "\n",
    "After optimizing the database, show how to complete the following updates. You can create fictional data. Ensure that previous data does not become stale:\n",
    "\n",
    "12) Add a new property with a new host in one of the top 10 cities. The host selects the top 10 most common amenities to list.\n",
    "\n",
    "13) Add a new review from one of our top 20 reviewers for this new property.\n",
    "\n",
    "14) Add a new review metric called 'x_factor' with a score of 10. Show that the average score across all metrics is correctly calculated for this listing, using the previously developed query.\n"

Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend.\"},\n",

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"}],\n",

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \\nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house.'},\n",

Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend.\"},\n",

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"}],\n",

Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on.

Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \\nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house.'},\n",

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \\nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got.\"},\n",

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"}],\n",

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibt Strassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. Im Umfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnell zurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben die Zeit wirklich genossen. \"},\n",

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers (not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \\nThe pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\\nOn the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphill walking distance from the house.'},\n",

The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"}]"

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \\nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got.\"},\n",

The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"},\n",

      "The longest comment is: 'my husband and I had a great stay at the gingerbread Cottage. It was extremely clean and had almost everything we needed. the bed was super comfortable and we had access to a washing machine and dryer every single day at no additional charge. Eve was even kind enough to leave Tide Pods for us to do our laundry. The bathroom was super roomy and we had plenty of storage space for our belongings. There were plenty of pots pans dishes and goodies for us when we got there. I thought it was very kind that they left Maui macadamia nut cookies and Maui coffee for us at no additional charge because hotels would charge you an arm and a leg for those additional amenities. we were also provided with boogie boards and yoga mats as well as a beach umbrella which was awesome because many resorts or hotels charge fees for those things and we thought it was really cool that Eve provided it with no additional charge. the property is nice because we truly felt like we were living like the locals but because of our location we were still close enough to enjoy all of the touristy Maui activities without having to travel too far. The gingerbread Cottage is literally like living in a jungle and the property is just gorgeous. there are mosquitoes and cane spiders ( which are huge) but we never saw a spider in our room and as long as we remembered to put bug spray on we never dealt with any mosquito problems. whenever we needed anything from toilet paper to ear earplugs to printed out boarding passes for a boat that we signed up to go for a sail on, eve was right there..... always responding within minutes of us reaching out to her and always helping us out within the hour. She was truly a very attentive host. She also has the sweetest golden retriever puppy we really enjoyed loving on and a secret garden that's open to the public that my husband and I really enjoyed visiting which is a must see when you're there. there are only a few things worth mentioning that might be bothersome for some people depending on what you expect out of the accommodations and I will mention those here. first thing is the shower. Everything on Maui is expensive so everyone has energy-efficient everything. Therefore, the shower only heats up for a couple of minutes. Eve says in her welcome book that the hot water lasts for 6 minutes but it feels a little shorter than that. she also says it only takes 10 minutes to heat up again after it gets cold but that's not true either. It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes to heat up again. So if you're the type of person that wants to take a nice long hot shower or if you're a couple and you guys want to shower immediately after each other, thats not going to happen at this Cottage. If my husband and I didn't take a shower together, we had to put aside about an extra hour or hour and a half so we could both have hot showers before we headed out. next, We were on our honeymoon so we didn't need a TV. But we were informed there was a TV and while there was no cable there was a DVD player so we thought we could watch our movies. but when we got there, there was no TV or DVD player in the room. so there is NO tv whatsoever. people should also know that there is no air conditioning and while Makawao is usually 10 degrees cooler than the outer parts of the island because it's UpCountry, there were still nights that I woke up in a sweat because I was hot. We weren't miserable or anything but there were definitely some days that especially when trying to sleep it would have been nice to have access to air conditioning and not just a stand-up fan. the only other thing that might drive people a little nuts is the Roosters. Wherever you go on the island of Maui there are wild chickens and roosters everywhere. So there's tons of these feathery guys on Eves property as they are a farm. we truly loved our feathery friends and we truly felt we bonded with them and they really didn't bother us initially..... but after about day 6 or 7 of waking up to our favorite rooster doing his morning rooster call at 4 a.m. we we're starting to get a little Punchy because we were losing sleep. So we had to reach out to Eve and she was kind enough to give us earplugs which helped me a lot but didn't really help my husband. so anyone that would have a problem with a rooster call at 4 am, you should reach out to eve before you get there and let her know that you want her to lure those chickens and roosters to another part of the property before you get there. also it's a little hard to get a decent Wi-Fi signal out there. like I said, we were on our honeymoon so the things I mentioned in here were very minor for us and didnt bother us at all really.... but depending on what you're hoping to get out of your stay we thought we should mention them because technology and basic things like long hot showers are taken for granted and people may not realize how important it is to them until they don't have access to it. We really like to be detached from everyone and everything and we don't like to be doted on and we aren't Resort people, so the things I mentioned were fine for us but for people that are typically Resort people, it may be quite the adjustment. personally, we absolutely loved our stay and we're talking about trying...'\n"

       "   'comments': \"The house was extremely well located and Ana was able to give us some really great tips on locations to have lunch and eat out. The house was perfectly clean and the easily able to accommodate 6 people despite only having one bathroom. The beds and living room were comfortable. \\n\\nHowever, we always felt somewhat on edge in the house due to the number of signs posted around the kitchen, bedrooms and bathroom about being charged 15€ for all sorts of extras like not washing up or using extra towels and bed linen. Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \\n\\nThe hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it.\"},\n",

But in warmer months Im sure this isn't an issue.\\nThe beds are a little hard with one slightly out of shape,  and the shower is fairly basic (hand held) but does the job. Because of the central location some noise can be expected early in the mornings. \\nOverall the apartment suited our needs for our short stay and the price is more than reasonable for what we got.\"},\n",

Ana communicated well regarding check in info, and was even flexible regarding check out timing. The description / pictures are relevant; only the bathroom  is not as recent. We appreciated the extra blanket as heaters have to be switched off once u leave the flat, but once they are switched on we had no problem afterwards regarding the temperature of the flat.'},\n",
